Things to do ONCE only:
1. Download "wiki.en.zip" from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html.
    - this contains the pre-trained fasttext word vectors 
    - make sure to get the English bin+text version
2. Extract "wiki.en.zip" to get "wiki.en.bin".
3. Run "pickle_fasttext_pretrained_model.py" to load and pickle the fasttext model.
    - this will speed up the loading time of future runs

Things to do every run:
1. In main.py, set the values for "COL_NAME" and "DESCR".
    - "COL_NAME": the name of the csv column containing the words to be normalized.
    - "DESCR": the name of the csv column containing the domain text.
2. Run "main.py" to get a DataFrame containing column names and their lists of derived column names.
